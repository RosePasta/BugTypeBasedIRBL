== Using the runner classes

Spring for Apache Hadoop provides for each Hadoop interaction type,
whether it is vanilla Map/Reduce, Hive or Pig, a _runner_, a dedicated
class used for declarative (or programmatic) interaction. The list below
illustrates the existing _runner_ classes for each type, their name and
namespace element.

|=======================================================================
|Type |Name |Namespace element |Description
|Map/Reduce `Job` |`JobRunner` |`job-runner` |Runner for Map/Reduce
jobs, whether vanilla M/R or streaming

|Hadoop `Tool` |`ToolRunner` |`tool-runner` |Runner for Hadoop `Tool`s
(whether stand-alone or as jars).

|Hadoop `jar`s |`JarRunner` |`jar-runner` |Runner for Hadoop jars.

|Hive queries and scripts |`HiveRunner` |`hive-runner` |Runner for
executing Hive queries or scripts.

|Pig queries and scripts |`PigRunner` |`pig-runner` |Runner for
executing Pig scripts.

|JSR-223/JVM scripts |`HdfsScriptRunner` |`script` |Runner for executing
JVM 'scripting' languages (implementing the JSR-223 API).

While most of the configuration depends on the underlying type, the
runners share common attributes and behaviour so one can use them in a
predictive, consistent way. Below is a list of common features:

* declaration does *not* imply execution
+
The runner allows a script, a job to run but the execution can be
triggered either programmatically or by the container at start-up.
* `run-at-startup`
+
Each runner can execute its action at start-up. By default, this flag is
set to `false`. For multiple or on demand execution (such as scheduling)
use the Callable contract (see below).
* JDK Callable interface
+
Each runner implements the JDK Callable interface. Thus one can inject
the runner into other beans or its own classes to trigger the execution
(as many or as little times as she wants).
* `pre` and `post` actions
+
Each runner allows one or multiple, pre or/and post actions to be
specified (to chain them together such as executing a job after another
or perfoming clean up). Typically other runners can be used but _any_
`Callable` can be specified. The actions will be executed before and
after the main action, in the declaration order. The runner uses a
_fail-safe_ behaviour meaning, any exception will interrupt the run and
will propagated immediately to the caller.
* consider Spring Batch
+
The runners are meant as a way to execute basic tasks. When multiple
executions need to be coordinated and the flow becomes non-trivial, we
strongly recommend using Spring Batch which provides all the features of
the runners and more (a complete, mature framework for batch execution).
