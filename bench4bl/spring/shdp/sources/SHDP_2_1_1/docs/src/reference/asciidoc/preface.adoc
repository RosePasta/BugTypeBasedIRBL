== Preface

Spring for Apache Hadoop provides extensions to Spring, Spring Batch,
and Spring Integration to build manageable and robust pipeline solutions
around Hadoop.

Spring for Apache Hadoop supports reading from and writing to HDFS,
running various types of Hadoop jobs (Java MapReduce, Streaming),
scripting and HBase, Hive and Pig interactions. An important goal is to
provide excellent support for non-Java based developers to be productive
using Spring for Apache Hadoop and not have to write any Java code to
use the core feature set.

Spring for Apache Hadoop also applies the familiar Spring programming
model to Java MapReduce jobs by providing support for dependency
injection of simple jobs as well as a POJO based MapReduce programming
model that decouples your MapReduce classes from Hadoop specific details
such as base classes and data types.

This document assumes the reader already has a basic familiarity with
the Spring Framework and Hadoop concepts and APIs.

While every effort has been made to ensure that this documentation is
comprehensive and there are no errors, nevertheless some topics might
require more explanation and some typos might have crept in. If you do
spot any mistakes or even more serious errors and you can spare a few
cycles during lunch, please do bring the error to the attention of the
Spring for Apache Hadoop team by raising an issue. Thank you.
