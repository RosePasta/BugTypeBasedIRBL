== WordCount Demo ==
====================

1. MOTIVATION

A basic word count demo that illustrates the configuration and interaction with Hadoop through Spring Hadoop.
The demo copies local resources into HDFS and executes the Hadoop example that counts words against it. The demo
requires a running Hadoop instance (by default at localhost:9000). 
The Hadoop settings can be configured through hadoop.properties (more info in the Spring Hadoop reference docs).

2. BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

This directory contains the source files.
For building, JDK 1.6+ are required

a) To build, test and run the sample, use the following command:

*nix/BSD OS:
$ ../gradlew

Windows OS:
$ ..\gradlew

If you have Gradle installed and available in your classpath, you can simply type:
$ gradle

3. IDE IMPORT

To import the code inside an IDE run the command

For Eclipse 
$ ../gradlew eclipse

For IDEA
$ ../gradlew idea

This will generate the IDE specific project files.
