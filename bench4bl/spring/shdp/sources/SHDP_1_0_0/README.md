The [Spring for Apache Hadoop](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/hadoop) provides extensions to [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/spring-core), [Spring Batch](http://www.springsource.org/spring-batch), and [Spring Integration](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) to build manageable and robust pipeline solutions around Hadoop.  

Spring for Apache Hadoop extends Spring Batch by providing support for reading from and writing to HDFS, running various types of Hadoop jobs (Java MapReduce, Streaming, [Hive](http://hive.apache.org),  [Pig](http://pig.apache.org)), [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org) and [Cascading](http://cascading.org) interactions. An important goal is to provide excellent support for non-Java based developers to be productive using Spring Hadoop and not have to write any Java code to use the core feature set.

Spring for Apache Hadoop also applies the familiar Spring programming model to Java MapReduce jobs by providing support for dependency injection of simple jobs as well as a POJO based MapReduce programming model that decouples your MapReduce classes from Hadoop specific details such as base classes and data types.

# Building

Spring for Apache Hadoop uses Gradle as its build system. To build the system simply run:

    gradlew

from the project root folder. This will compile the sources, run the tests and create the artifacts.

## Supported distros

By default Spring for Apache Hadoop compiles against Apache Hadoop 1.0.x. Apache Hadoop 1.1.x (hadoop11) and Cloudera CDH3 (cdh3) and CDH4 (cdh4) are also supported; to compile against them pass the `-Pdistro=<label>` project property, like so:

    gradlew -Pdistro=hadoop11 build
    
Note that the chosen distro is displayed on the screen:

    Using Apache Hadoop 1.1.x [1.1.0]

In this case, the specified Hadoop distribution (above Apache Hadoop 1.1.x) is used to create the project binaries. This option is useful when testing against Hadoop clusters incompatible with the Hadoop stable line.

# Testing

For its testing, Spring for Apache Hadoop expects a pseudo-distributed/local Hadoop instalation available on the `localhost` at the default ports (`9000` and `9001`). The local Hadoop setup allows
the project classpath to be automatically used by the Hadoop job tracker. These settings can be customized in two ways:
* Build properties

From the command-line, use `hd.fs` for the file-system (to avoid confusion, specify the protocol such as 'hdfs://', 's3://', etc - if none is specified, `hdfs://` will be used), `hd.jt` for the jobtracker and `hd.hive` for the Hive host/port information, to override the defaults. For example to run against HDFS at `dumbo:8020` one would use:

    gradlew -Phd.fs=hdfs://dumbo:8020 build

* Properties file

Through the `test.properties` file under `src/test/resources` folder (further tweaks can be applied through `hadoop-ctx.xml` file under `src/test/resources/org/springframework/data/hadoop`).

## Enabling Hbase/Hive/Pig/WebHdfs Tests
Note that by default, only the vanilla Hadoop tests are running - you can enable additional tests (such as Hive or Pig) by adding the tasks `enableHBaseTests`, `enableHiveTests`, `enablePigTests` and `webHdfsTests` (or `enableAllTests` in short). Use `test.properties` file for customizing the default location for these services as well.

## Disabling test execution
You can disable all tests by skipping the `test` task:

    gradlew -x test
